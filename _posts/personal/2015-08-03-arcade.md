## Searching for an Old Game

Back in 2006, my wife was looking for a game she loved to play when she was a kid called _Lock n' Chase_. While searching for this game, I came across the Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator, otherwise known as [MAME](http://mamedev.org). I instantly decided to build the toy I always wanted, and arcade cabinet. My wife quickly agreed as long as she could play _Lock n' Chase_.

## The Initial Build

We had recently upgraded our computer, so I had an old Windows XP system just waiting to be repurposed. This machine formed the basis of my first build of the arcade cabinet.

#### The Hardware:

1. [IPac2](http://ultimarc.com/ipac1.html) keyboard encoder used to connect the arcade controls to the computer.
2. [Ultimate Joysticks](http://na.suzohapp.com/amusement_products/joysticks/) from Suzo Happ. My configuration used (2) 4 way joysticks (one was set at an angle specifically for Q*bert), and (2) 8 way joysticks.
3. [Pushbuttons with horizontal switch](http://na.suzohapp.com/amusement_products/pushbuttons/) also from Suzo Happ.
4. [Small single door - 2 entry](http://na.suzohapp.com/amusement_products/coin_doors/40-0055-00) also from Suzo Happ. What better way to emulate that arcade feel than to require quarters to play!
5. Some cheap computer speakers.

#### The Cabinet:

The cabinet was constructed from 3/4" MDF, which was a very bad idea. This definitely provided a solid structure, but this was at the expense of it being extremely heavy. The marquee and monitor were covered with Lexan, and the marquee was backlit with a cheap florescent light. The cabinet was painted to match a Ms. Pacman cabinet (another one of my wife's favorite games). I guess you could call it a thank you for letting me build it. Some black [T-molding](http://www.t-molding.com/3-4in-black-t-molding.html) completed the cabinet.

#### The Software:

The [Mala](http://www.malafe.net) front end provided the GUI for the arcade. In addition to MAME, this front end provided access to the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Sega Genesis, and Arcade Laserdisc Emulators that I had installed. To give it more of an arcade feel, I took steps to _hide_ the OS following instructions similar to [these](http://wiki.arcadecontrols.com/wiki/Hiding_Windows).

The completed arcade was a blast, but I discovered I had more fun building it than playing it. Needless to say, it soon began to evolve.
