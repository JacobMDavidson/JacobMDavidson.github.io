I’m a former structural engineer working on my master’s degree in computer science at the University of Illinois at Springfield. I worked as a structural engineer for nearly eight years before making the decision to change careers. [Life circumstances]({% post_url /personal/2015-05-16-about-me %}) caused me to reevaluate my chosen career path in late 2012. This evaluation resulted in leaving my old career behind and beginning the journey toward a new career in software development. Now that I’m on the brink of overcoming the first hurdle in my journey, it’s safe to say I’ve made the right choice!
